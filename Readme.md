CMPT 364 Final Project

Rating Count for Video Games Using Hadoop MapReduce

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings

The games-list.csv file was cleaned and separated into five different files, each corresponding to a distinct rating.

The data was modified using the separate.py code, then was put into four distinct .csv files.

The resulting files, as well as the java code was copied into the Master machine using scp.

RatingCount was run on these files separately, and together.

The Screenshots of the output are included in the screenshots folder.
